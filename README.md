# SeeLinePlus
SeeLinePlus is, at it's core, a horizontal semi-transparent line that's as wide as the monitor and follows the mouse. It's an accessibility tool that helps people read.

This is a rewrite of a tool I wrote for my dad in 2002.

It's a work in progress since I'm making it easy to add new variations and toggle them through a tray icon.

On the technical side this is designed so that my dad (in his 70's) can experiment with modifications, so simplicity is a guiding principle.
